          Since I was a child, I have always been greatly interested in
          computers and interfaces. After working a bit with social media
          marketing at the start of 2020, I quickly realized that I wanted
          something differentâ€”to build something.

        <p className="mb-4">
          That is why I chose in 2022, to start studying Multimedia Design at
          Copenhagen School of Arts and Technology. This led me to discover that
          I had a great passion for Frontend Development.

          As my studies draw to a close in early 2024, I have decided to
          continue my educational journey. With a newfound goal in mind, I am
          now diving into the world of Web Development, aiming to become a more
          versatile and holistic developer.
